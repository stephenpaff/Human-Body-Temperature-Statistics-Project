# Human-Body-Temperature-Statistics-Project
In this project, I statistically analyze a study on human body temperature, using Pandas in Jupyter. This was an assignment for a statistics project. In addition to my actual statistical analysis, I included a description of the academic study and questions I address in "Statistical Analysis.ipynb."
